# Generic Simple Report

The following repo contains simple set of files that can be used to conveniently generate a TeX report with a number of fairly common setting, which I personally find useful when generating standard reports. Those include:

* Margins 20mm
* Footer of format `author` and `page / no_all_pages`
* Fairly densely packaged title on the front page
* Title of the document across the header
* Convenient line spacing

In addition to the TeX configuration the repo provides a makefile facilitating delivery of common tasks such as report generation and cleaning.
