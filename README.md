# Generic Simple Report

The following repo contains simple set of files that can be used to conveniently generate a TeX report with a number of fairly common setting, which I personally find useful when generating standard reports. Those include

* Margins 20mm
* Footer of format `page / no_all_pages`

In addition to the TeX configuration the repo provides a makefile facilitating delivery of common tasks such as report generation and cleaning.
